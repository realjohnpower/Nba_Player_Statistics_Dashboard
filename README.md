# Nba_Player_Statistics_Dashboard

This is a dash booard using plotly dash I made on the NBA Player dataset by Justinas Cirtautas that has Nba player statistics from 1996 - 2022.

I researched into trends such as the emergence of Nba international players from 1996 - 2022, the average weight, height and age of nba players over time and USA and International players in points, assists and rebounds in each season.

Here is a link to the dashboard below:
